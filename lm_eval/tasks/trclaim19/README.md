Title: `TrClaim-19: The First Collection for Turkish Check-Worthy Claim Detection with Annotator Rationales`

Abstract: https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.31/

Massive misinformation spread over Internet has many negative impacts on our lives. While spreading a claim is easy, investigating its veracity is hard and time consuming, Therefore, we urgently need systems to help human fact-checkers. However, available data resources to develop effective systems are limited and the vast majority of them is for English. In this work, we introduce TrClaim-19, which is the very first labeled dataset for Turkish check-worthy claims. TrClaim-19 consists of labeled 2287 Turkish tweets with annotator rationales, enabling us to better understand the characteristics of check-worthy claims. The rationales we collected suggest that claimsâ€™ topics and their possible negative impacts are the main factors affecting their check-worthiness.
